Personal Website

This is my personal website that I quickly put together for the sole purpose of having an online resource for potential employers to
learn a bit about me, view my LinkedIn and Twitter, see my projects on GitHub and even download a copy of my CV.

The website itself isn't a lot to look at as there is only two pages but I did take pride in the design.

I also demonstrated my knowledge of using Robot Framework and the Selenium library for very basic automation tests.
